**Emby Updater for Debian/Ubuntu**

This script checks to see if there is an available Emby update and completes the update for you. It then cleans up the file. This can be easily updated for other Linux distros.

- There is one variable that needs to be updated in the script: server_url
-- It should be updated to your accessible URL, either local or remote and port number if required
